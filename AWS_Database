# Data source types
- Structured data is often organized to support transactional and analytical applications. 
Structured data is most commonly stored in relational databases but can also be stored in non-relational databases. 
This data source type is valuable because you can gain insight into overarching trends by efficiently running powerful data queries and analysis.

- Semistructured data can be just as predictable and organized as structured data. 
The difference is that semistructured data is flexible and can be updated without the requirement to change the schema for every single record in a table. 
Semistructured data allows a user to capture any data in any structure as data evolves and changes over time. 
Semistructured data is often stored in non-relational stores.

- Unstructured data is not organized in any distinguishable or predefined manner. 
Common stores for unstructured data are non-relational key-value databases. 
Unstructured data is full of irrelevant information, which means data needs to first be processed to perform any kind of meaningful analysis.

***** Relational Database
- Relational databases rely on a series of structures, called tables, to hold data. 
These tables group data based on a person, place, thing, or event related to that data. 
These groupings are referred to as entities. Each entity is stored as a table.

A column, known as a field, describes one attribute of the entity. 
A row, known as a record, represents a single instance of an entity. 
Think of a spreadsheet, where each row has a cell for each column. 
Each cell can contain a value. Rules within the schema define if the attribute is required or optional.

- Online transaction processing (OLTP) databases focus on recording Update, Insertion, and Deletion data transactions. 
OLTP queries are simple and short, which requires less time and space to process. 
A great example of an OLTP system is a bank ATM, in which you can modify your bank account using short transactions. 

- Online analytical processing (OLAP) databases store historical data that has been input by OLTP.
OLAP databases allow users to view different summaries of multidimensional data. 
Using OLAP, you can extract information from a large database and analyze it for decision-making. A good example of an OLAP system is a business intelligence tool.
