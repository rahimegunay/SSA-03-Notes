# AWS Global network
AWS Regions have 3 main benefits
1- Each region has separate geographically (Isolated Fault Domain)
2- Geopolitical separation (ifferent Governance)
3- Locational Control(Perfomance)

-----------------------------------
Every region has multiple Availability Zones(AZ) it could be 2,3,4,5 and 6

## NOTES 
- Use a serverless achitecture when you are starting from a scratch
- Leverage Amazon  S3, Amazon Cloudfront, Amazon API Gateway, Step Functions, Amazon cognito, AWS AppSync for serverless environment
- Use Amazon EC&EKS when using a Docker container.
- Use AWS Fargate to manage container provisioning and scaling
- Use Amazon Elastic Beanstalk when working with monolithic applications.


## AWS Storage
Why organizations move to the cloud?
- Increased organizational agility.
- Storage agility in AWS
- Accelerate ability to innovate
- Strengthen security
