AWS Step Functions is a serverless orchestration service. Y
ou can use it to combine AWS Lambda functions and other AWS services to build business-critical applications. 
With AWS Step Functions, you can build visual workflows that help you rapidly translate business requirements into applications. 
Through Step Functions' graphical console, you see your application's workflow as a series of event-driven steps. 

Step Functions is based on state machines and tasks. 
A state machine is a workflow. A task is a state in a workflow that represents a single unit of work performed by another AWS service. Each step in a workflow is a state.

Step Functions manages state, checkpoints, and restarts for you, and it provides built-in capabilities to automatically deal with errors and exceptions. 
Step Functions provides the scalability, reliability, and availability needed to successfully manage your data processing workflows. 
You can manage millions of concurrent executions with Step Functions because it scales horizontally and provides fault-tolerant workflows.

Step Functions uses IAM to control access to others services and resources. 
To maintain security, you must grant Step Functions access to those resources by using an IAM role. It is always a best practice to include only the permissions that are necessary in your IAM policies.
Step Functions provides several ways to manage your microservice workflows. 
For long-running workflows, you can use Standard Workflows. For short-duration, high-volume workflows that require an immediate response, synchronous Express Workflows are ideal.
For short-duration workflows that do not require an immediate response, Step Functions provides asynchronous Express Workflows.
