# Network Communication Protocols
How do we ensure your communication across the network? Communication protocols determine the formats and rules used to transfer data over the network. 
This applies to both hardware and software. 
Communication protocols also handle authentication and error detection as well as the syntax, synchronization, and semantics that both analog and digital communications must abide by to function.

HTTP – Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP)(opens in a new tab) is an application layer protocol that allows the browser and server to communicate.
TCP – Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)(opens in a new tab) separates data into packets that can be shared over a network. 
These packets can then be sent by devices like switches and routers to the designated targets.
UDP – User Datagram Protocol (UDP)(opens in a new tab) works in a similar way to TCP, sending packets of data over the network. 
The key difference between the two is that TCP ensures that a connection is made between the application and server, but UDP does not.
IRC – Internet Relay Chat (IRC)(opens in a new tab) is a text-based communication protocol. 
Software clients are used to communicate with servers and send messages to other clients. This protocol works well on networks with a large number of distributed machines.


# Network Management Protocols
Network management protocols define the policies and procedures used to monitor, manage, and maintain your network. 
This ensures stable communication and optimal performance for your network, and these protocols can be applied to all devices on your network (computers, switches, routers, and servers).

Management protocols help to: 

Troubleshoot connections between host and client devices. 
Provide connection status, availability, packet or data loss, and so on related to the health of your network connection.
Common network management protocols:

SNMP – Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)(opens in a new tab) is used to monitor and manage network devices. 
This TCP-based protocol adds visibility and the ability to modify endpoints which alter behavior of devices across the network. 
SNMP relies on the use of agents to collect and send data to an overarching SNMP manager, which in turn queries agents and gets their responses.
ICMP – Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)(opens in a new tab) is primarily used for diagnostic purposes. 
Managed devices on the network can use this protocol to send error messages, providing information regarding network connectivity issues between devices.

# Network Security Protocols

Network security protocols ensure that data traffic on your network is secure. 
These protocols define how the network secures data from malicious attempts. This protects the data from unauthorized users, services, or devices that access your network data.

Network security protocols rely on encryption and cryptography to secure data.

Common security protocols: 

SSL – A Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)(opens in a new tab) is a network security protocol primarily used for ensuring secure internet connections and protecting sensitive data. This protocol can allow for server/client communication as well as server/server communication. Data transferred with SSL is encrypted to prevent it from being readable.
SFTP – Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)(opens in a new tab), as its name might suggest, is used to securely transfer files across a network. Data is encrypted and the client and server are authenticated.
HTTPS – Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol(opens in a new tab) is the secure version of HTTP. Data sent between the browser and server are encrypted to ensure protection.

Summary of AWS VPC
1. Amazon VPCs live entirely within the AWS Cloud.
2. An Amazon VPC lives in one Region.
3. A subnet can only live in one Availability Zone.
4. Some AWS resources must be launched into an Amazon VPC.
5. Internet gateways let your VPC resources reach the internet.
6. Route tables control the routing of traffic coming into, going out of, and moving within your Amazon VPC.

Additional Amazon VPC considerations

- The only architectural difference between a public and private subnet is that a public subnet has a route to an internet gateway.


- By default, DNS is handled by Amazon VPC. It is possible, however, to use Amazon Route 53 to create your own DNS inside an Amazon VPC with private hosted zones.


- All traffic is unicast and Amazon VPCs do not require the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP).


- By default, all subnets in an Amazon VPC can access each other. You can use network network ACLs to restrict traffic into and out of your subnets.


- All traffic between two points in the same Amazon VPC is forwarded directly.


******NOTES******
Stateful is allowing traffic in and the response out automatically. (Security Groups)

Stateless is allowing traffic in and the response is blocked from leaving unless explicitly permitted by a rule.(Network ACL-Access Control List)

***Network Connectivity Concepts***
networking concepts in the context of the AWS Cloud:

- Multi-tier architecture
- Multi-VPC architecture
- High availability
- Hybrid networks
- High performance

******NOTES********
A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that lets you route traffic between them privately.

* These specific AWS services used in architecting your network:

VPC endpoints and AWS PrivateLink
VPC peering
Direct Connect
AWS Site-to-Site VPN and Client VPN
AWS Transit Gateway

****NOTES***
!!!!The network design is the network infrastructure that refers to all of the resources of a network that make network or internet connectivity, management, business operations, and communication possible. 
Network infrastructure comprises hardware and software, systems and devices, and it enables computing and communication between users, services, applications and processes. Anything involved in the network, from servers to wireless routers, comes together to make up a system’s network infrastructure and should be documented and updated with any and all changes.

The other response options are incorrect because:

Network baselines are ideal performance metrics obtained by measuring your network for a particular time period.
Performance monitoring systems refers to any tool or application designed to collect health status data and performance metrics about a network's or system's operational health.
Security monitoring systems monitors to help protect from the potential vulnerabilities and exploits.
