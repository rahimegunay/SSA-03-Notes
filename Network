Netwrok Communication Protocols
How do we ensure your communication across the network? Communication protocols determine the formats and rules used to transfer data over the network. 
This applies to both hardware and software. 
Communication protocols also handle authentication and error detection as well as the syntax, synchronization, and semantics that both analog and digital communications must abide by to function.

HTTP – Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP)(opens in a new tab) is an application layer protocol that allows the browser and server to communicate.
TCP – Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)(opens in a new tab) separates data into packets that can be shared over a network. 
These packets can then be sent by devices like switches and routers to the designated targets.
UDP – User Datagram Protocol (UDP)(opens in a new tab) works in a similar way to TCP, sending packets of data over the network. 
The key difference between the two is that TCP ensures that a connection is made between the application and server, but UDP does not.
IRC – Internet Relay Chat (IRC)(opens in a new tab) is a text-based communication protocol. 
Software clients are used to communicate with servers and send messages to other clients. This protocol works well on networks with a large number of distributed machines.
