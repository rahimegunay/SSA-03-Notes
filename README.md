OSI(Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that describes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computer system. 
The model is divided into seven layers, each of which performs a specific function in the transmission of data between networked devices.
These layers are designed to provide a standardized approach to network communication, allowing different types of devices to communicate with each other regardless of their underlying hardware or software. 
By understanding the functions of each layer in the OSI model, network engineers and IT professionals can design, implement, and troubleshoot complex networks more efficiently and effectively.

Layer 1, also known as the physical layer, is the first and lowest layer in the OSI model. It is responsible for the physical transmission of data over a communication channel, such as a wire, cable, or wireless signal. This layer defines the physical characteristics of the communication medium, including voltage levels, cable types, and signaling methods, to ensure that data is transmitted accurately and reliably between devices. In this lesson, we will explore the functions and protocols of Layer 1 in detail to understand how it enables communication between devices in a network.

Layer 2, also known as the data link layer, is the second layer in the OSI model. It is responsible for the reliable transfer of data between two nodes on the same network segment. This layer defines protocols for the access and use of the physical network, such as addressing, flow control, and error detection and correction. In this lesson, we will explore the functions and protocols of Layer 2 in detail to understand how it enables communication between devices on the same network segment.

Layer 3, also known as the network layer, is the third layer in the OSI model. It is responsible for the end-to-end delivery of data between devices on different network segments. This layer defines protocols for logical addressing, routing, and fragmentation of data packets to ensure that they are delivered to the correct destination across different networks. In this lesson, we will explore the functions and protocols of Layer 3 in detail to understand how it enables communication between devices on different network segments.

Layer 4, the transport layer, is responsible for ensuring that data is delivered reliably and efficiently from one device to another. It does this by establishing connections between applications on different devices, and managing flow control and error recovery. This layer defines two main protocols: the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). In this lesson, we will explore the functions and protocols of Layer 4 in detail to understand how it enables reliable end-to-end communication between devices.

Layer 5, the session layer, is responsible for managing the communication sessions between applications running on different devices. It defines protocols for session establishment, maintenance, and termination, as well as for managing session security and synchronization. In this lesson, we will explore the functions and protocols of Layer 5 in detail to understand how it enables seamless communication between applications on different devices.
