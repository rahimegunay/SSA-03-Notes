AWS DMS and AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT) can help you migrate your databases to or from AWS quickly and securely. 
Using AWS DMS, your source database remains fully operational during migration, minimizing downtime to applications that rely on the database.
You can migrate to the same database engine, or switch database engines to modernize your database platform. 
You can also replicate data to sync source and target databases.
